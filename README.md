# Angular Debug Quest

- Want to sharpen your skills at fixing bugs in Angular applications for a better understanding of the framework?
- Need to train for a technical interview?

This project is for you!

## The idea

The idea is simple. The application is full of bugs. Your task is to fix them.

It's completely up to you to choose your strategy and to identify each bug!

Some of them might be easy to spot with a runtime error, but some of them might be tricky and require to understand what the code is aiming for.

## How to play

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. Run `npm run server` to start the JSON server
4. Run `npx nx serve angular-debug-quest` to start the application
5. Open the application in your browser
6. Fix the bugs

## Scope of the project

The project is a simple Angular application with unrelated features to cover a wide scope of bugs.

## Scope of the bugs

The bugs are meant to test your knowledge of Angular.

## Limitations

This project is meant to be a training ground, not a production application following modern best practices. Not only you might find some inconsistencies in the code but incompleted features.

## What's next?

### You identified a bug?

Being able not only to use Angular but to fix errors is the first step at mastering it! The next one is to be able to explain what you did!

Share your solution with the community on social media!

### Contributions

> Contributions are welcomed to add new bugs.
> However the project is not meant to be fixed itself, so bug fixes contributions won't be accepted.
